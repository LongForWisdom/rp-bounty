## Description

Additions or improvements to the official FAQ documentation located at on the [official documentation site](https://docs.rocketpool.net/overview/faq.html). Multiple answers can receive multiple payouts. 

## Requires
* The GMC must explicitly accept the FAQ addition or improvement in the forum topic.
* The addition or improvement must be merged to the official documentation by the core team. 

## Optionals
* Fantastic answers are not only accurate, but easily understood and shared.
* Support templates added to the discord server, providing a TL;DR answer that links to more information in the documentation. 

## Further Notes

Some questions that recently come to mind are:
* How does Rocket Pool work? [high level intro]
* Do I get rETH as an NO?
* Why do we have RPL?
* What if rETH depegs?
* Why isn’t rETH 1:1 with ETH?

Some of these can be in official documentation. That would be best and get incorporated via PRs. 

Where there’s some opinion bits that may help (eg the RPL question; perhaps the depeg question?) I would suggest hackmd or medium or such. In an ideal world, this gets used in a support template with the support template being a true TL;DR and the article doing the heavier lifting. All of the answers should cover LEB8s, if relevent.
