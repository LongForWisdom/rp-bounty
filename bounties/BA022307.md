## Description

One answer to a frequently asked question added to the liquid stakers section of the Rocket Pool official documentation. Multiple answers can receive multiple payouts. 

Note, the section does not exist at the time of this bounty being posted.

## Requires
* Add the liquid stakers FAQ section, if not already present. It should be located [here](https://github.com/rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net/tree/main/docs/guides/staking)).
* Addition or improvement of one or more frequently asked questions in the liquid stakers FAQ.
* The addition to the official documentation must be merged by the core team. 
* jcrtp must approve the guide and bounty payout. 

## Optionals
* No optional criteria.

## Further Notes

While the documentation is thorough in its walkthroughs of how to swap tokens, we still see a lot of questions in Discord about the process and the options. That implies there is an audience for an FAQ section on the docs for liquid stakers which is unfortunately missing. Adding one would help prospective liquid stakers that arenâ€™t familiar with (or comfortable with) our Discord get the answers they need regarding common questions about the token and the swapping process.
