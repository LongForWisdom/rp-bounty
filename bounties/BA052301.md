## Description
Create an independent implementation of treegen (the tool used to generate rewards merkle trees for the Rocket Pool protocol) and use it to verify that a change to the rewards specification is implemented correctly in the official treegen tool. 

## Requires
* Create or update an independent version of treegen with a new rewards specification without duplicating the new code from the Rocket Pool development team.
* Work with the Rocket Pool development team to compare rewards tree outputs, and resolve any differences between the two implementations. 
* The rewards specification must be 'live' in that the specifications will be used for the next rewards distribution. 

## Optionals
* No optionals.

## Further Notes

The reward is set at $1500 per new treegen specification. The reward for each specification will be split between bounty hunters that meet the listed requires. Open source treegen implementations will be given twice the weight when splitting the reward. 

This bounty is only claimable when the treegen specification is changing.
