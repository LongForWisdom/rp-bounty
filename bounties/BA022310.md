## Description

Create a Smartnode addon for Rocketarb that supports arbitrage capture for both new minipool deposits and minipool closes / final distributions.

## Requires

The candidate implementation will be an addon in the Smartnode stack (similar to the Graffiti Wall Writer) that allows both deposits and minipool closure to route via the Rocketarb methodology instead of directly submitting transactions to the Execution client. The Smartnode should check if the addon has been enabled during either process, and prompt the user if they want to use it in the CLI; it should then adjust its behavior accordingly.

Note that this implies it will only be available for Docker and Hybrid mode users.

The addon should also come with a pull request to our documentation guides repository (GitHub - rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net: Rocket Pool Documentation & Guide Hub) with complete and thorough documentation describing its configuration and usage for Docker, Hybrid, and Native Mode (if applicable) users alike.

I will also ask the Rocket Scientists to scrutinize the candidate implementation(s) from a security perspective to ensure the capability does not introduce any attack vectors or vulnerabilities.

## Optionals

A supplemental standalone binary for Native Mode users with setup instructions is desired, though not required for completion of the bounty.

## Further Notes

Rocketarb is a community-created addon made by @ramana that allows node operators to capture arbitrage from the space created in the deposit pool when making a new minipool (assuming there is a significant premium on rETH on the secondary market). This is currently done using third-party tooling that leverages some undocumented features in the Smartnode’s daemon process.

I’d like to bring Rocketarb directly into the Smartnode as an official addon. This would give new node operators (and old ones) the ability to capture a “bonus” from the rETH price difference between the Rocket Pool contracts and the going market rate, which could be quite significant in some cases - often paying for the entire gas cost associated with creating the minipool.
