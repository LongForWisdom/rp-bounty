## Description

One answer to a frequently asked question added to the node operators section of the Rocket Pool official documentation. Multiple answers can receive multiple payouts. 

## Requires
* Addition or improvement of one or more frequently asked questions in the node operator FAQ located [here](https://github.com/rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net/blob/main/docs/guides/node/faq.md).
* The addition to the official documentation must be merged by the core team. 
* jcrtp must approve the guide and bounty payout. 

## Optionals
* No optional criteria.

## Further Notes

New node operators tend to have a lot of questions, and as thorough as the guides are, they still have some gaps that require specialized, directed questions and answers. The site has an FAQs section but it is woefully out of date so it doesn’t do a good job of answering questions from first-time node operators. Embellishing it akin to the support bot in Discord would go a long way to helping build confidence for node operators who are unsure about certain things and don’t know / don’t want to reach out to the support channel.

At the very least, porting over the common prompts from the support bot would be a start; I expect this is a good exercise for most of our experienced community members to aggregate questions they’ve frequently answered though, including ones the bot doesn’t have.
