## Description

Construct or Review a Rocket Pool scorecard that can be added to the Rocket Pool website (or similar) in the same theme as the [Lido Scorecard](https://lido.fi/scorecard).

## Requires
* Must allow the output to be used and built upon. Attribution and share-alike style requirements are ok.
* Must score Rocket Pool on the same criteria as the Lido scorecard.
* Must hit both high and low points accurately.
* Must note the parties affected by any existing risks.
* Must have acceptable UX.
* The GMC must approve each milestone.

## Optionals
* Up to an additional $5,000 available for quality of both UX and content.

## Further Notes

This bounty must be divided into milestones.

* **Milestone 1**: A working example of the web page
* **Milestone 2**: Reviewed by the community for at least 2 weeks, with at least 2 significant community reviews being written up
* **Milestone 3**: Integrating feedback and publishing

Bounties for milestones are awarded according to the following scheme:
* **Milestone 1**: First to publish a scorecard that meets the requirements recieves $5,000. Up to an additional $5,000 will be awarded based on assessment of quality by the GMC. If itâ€™s similar to the Lido example (nearly complete; easy to read and digest), target is $4,000.
* **Milestone 2**: $3,000 split between all reviewers. The GMC may subjectively determine the split based on review quality.
* **Milestone 3**: $2,000, reserved for 1 month to awardee of milestone 1 bounty. After that period, the first to publish receives the award.
