## Description

Construct or Review a Rocket Pool scorecard that can be added to the Rocket Pool website (or similar) in the same theme as the [Lido Scorecard](https://lido.fi/scorecard).

## Requires
* Must allow the output to be used and built upon. Attribution and share-alike style requirements are ok.
* Must score Rocket Pool on the same criteria as the Lido scorecard.
* Must hit both high and low points accurately.
* Must note the parties affected by any existing risks.
* Must have acceptable UX.
* The GMC must approve each milestone.

## Optionals
* Up to an additional $5,000 available for quality of both UX and content.

## Further Notes

This bounty must be divided into milestones.

* **Milestone 1**
  * A fully constructed mobile-responsive webpage for both the dark and light versions of rocketpool.net
  * Integration of UX and design requests from a community post on dao.rocketpool.net
  * Integrated with RP site (not live, but "one-click" away) and easy to maintain or fill in. (I'll contact Nick to see if we set it up to host on GMC github, otherwise we'll use the best workaround.)
* **Milestone 2**: The creation of content that is unique, high quality, and has been reviewed.

Bounties for milestones are awarded according to the following scheme:
* **Milestone 1**: $5000
* **Milestone 2**: $2,000 - $8,000 is allocated to be split among reviewers and content creators. The amount of compensation is based on the quality of the content.

## Updates

* 2024-01-25 - Revised milestones
* 2024-02-01 - Anthias Labs completed milestone 1
