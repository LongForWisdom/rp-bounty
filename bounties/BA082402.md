## Summary
Create a non-custodial staking as a service option similar to AllNodes. 

## Required Milestones

### Milestone A - Specification
**Payout:** $5,000  

#### Product Specification
* You must deliver a fully written project specification including the design and implementation scope of the project.
* The product must be compatible with the Rocket Pool protocol.
* The product must be non-custodial (can have validator key shared, but not node wallet or withdrawal wallet.)
* The product must be compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux.
* Graffiti must label the users of the service

#### Business Plan
* You must deliver a business plan demonstrating the financial viability and sustainability of the validating service without the bounty subsidiary.

### Milestone B - Working Product
**Payout:** $20,000  

* You must provide evidence of a functioning product.
* The product must be meet the the specification requirements laid out in Milestone A.
* The product must have at least 10 users using the Rocket Pool contracts.
* The product must have at least 100 minipools as defined in the Rocket Pool contracts.
* Must be completed by the same party to complete Milestone A, unless that party has explicitly granted consent for completion by another party.

### Milestone C - Scaling
**Payout:** $60,000  

* You must provide evidence of a functioning and scalable product.
* The product must be meet the the specification requirements laid out in Milestone A.
* Block proposals made by users of the Rocket Pool contracts within the product must exceed 5% of the proposals made by users of Allnode's Rocket Pool service over the period of a week. 
* Must be completed within six months of the completion of milestone A.
* Must be completed by the same party to complete Milestone A, unless that party has explicitly granted consent for completion by another party.

## Further Notes

The service need not be identifical to AllNodes. For example, it could require running something very lightweight on a home computer, which could be run on a primary machine (as opposed to dedicated hardware).

## Verification
* The GMC must approve each milestone.
* Please contact the GMC Administrator to arrange review of each milestone as it is completed.
