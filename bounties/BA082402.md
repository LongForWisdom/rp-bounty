## Description
Create a non-custodial staking as a service option similar to AllNodes. In a worst-case scenario, the RP validators could act as part of a cabal or self-slash to grief. Limiting that set is useful. Note also that allnodes has quite a lot of stake, eg from Lido.

It need not be identical. For example, it could require running something very lightweight on a home computer, which could be run on a primary machine (as opposed to dedicated hardware).

## Requires
* The GMC must approve each milestone.
* Must be non-custodial (can have validator key shared, but not node wallet or withdrawal wallet)
* Graffiti must label the users of the service
* Milestone 0 must be completed within six months of this bounty's publish date. Milestone 2 must be completed within six months of milestone 0
* Product must be compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux
* Milestones will be accomplished either by the same entity or, in the event that the successful claimant of milestone 0 explicitly grants consent, by another party to complete milestones 2 and 3

## Further Notes
This bounty must be divided into milestones.

* **Milestone 0**: A fully written project specification outlining the design and implementation scope and including a business model for the financial viability and sustainability of the validating service without the bounty subsidiary
* **Milestone 1**: A functioning product with 10 users and 100 minipools
* **Milestone 2**: 5% the size of allnodes (within RP) â€“ measured by block proposals across a week

Bounties for milestones are awarded according to the following scheme:
* **Milestone 0**: First to write a detailed project specification receives $5,000
* **Milestone 1**: $20,000
* **Milestone 2**: $60,000
