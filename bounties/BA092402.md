## Further Notes

* [Correct rocketpool_node approximate rpl reward panel for RPIP-30 changes](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/439)
  * This will make the “Approx. RPL at Next Checkpoint” metrics more accurate for RPIP-30
* [Networks should not be hard-coded](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/438)
  * This will make smartnode maintenance easier by adding a networks.yml file that makes it easy to add and remove networks (such as deprecating goerli/prater). Currently changing the supported smartnode networks requires changing the binary.
* [[bug] Watchtower fails to fall back to archive EC in generateRewardsTree when primary ec isn't useful](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/397)
  * This will improve oDAO treegen reliability. The solution is in the ticket, it just needs to get added to the code and tested.
* [Feature Request: rocketpool service prune and rocketpool service reset](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/issues/323)
  * These commands are more ergonomic and will make the burden in #support slightly lessened.
