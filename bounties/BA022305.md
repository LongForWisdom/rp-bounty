## Description

Create a guide concerning the setup of metrics collection and the Grafana dashboard for Native Mode node operators.

## Requires
* Addition of a native-mode grafana and metrics collection guide to the [official guide documentation](https://github.com/rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net/blob/main/docs/guides/node/grafana.md). 
* Replace all “Coming Soon!” content for Native Mode with detailed and complete instructions for metrics and Grafana operation in Native configurations.
* The addition to the official documentation must be merged by the core team. 
* jcrtp must approve the guide and bounty payout. 

## Optionals
* No optional criteria.

## Further Notes

The Grafana dashboard is an important tool for assessing the health, stability, and income of a Rocket Pool node. Right now, “official” support is limited to Docker mode users. New users (especially those who are solo stakers intending to migrate) may run in Native mode configurations should have access as well so they can track their node’s performance as easily as Docker mode users.
