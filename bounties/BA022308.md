## Description

Add notifications support to the Rocket Pool Smartnode.

## Requires

Bounty payout will be done by extensively testing the notification implementation on our Goerli testnet and, to the extent possible, on Mainnet. Acceptance will involve the successful notification to the node operator including, but not limited to, the following events:

* Client sync complete
* Client(s) lost sync
* Disk free space is running low (say, 15% free remaining) and the user should consider pruning if using Geth or Nethermind
* node automatically staked a minipool, or attempted to (success or failure)
* node automatically promoted a vacant minipool, or attempted to (success or failure)
* node automatically reduced a minipool’s bond, or attempted to (success or failure)
* node detected a fee recipient change
* node automatically distributed a minipool’s balance
* You have a block proposal this epoch
* You submitted a block proposal
* You are scheduled for the next sync committee
* You have entered a sync committee
* There is a new Smartnode update available

Notifications must be configurable, meaning they need to have first-class support as a dedicated page in the service config TUI with parameters to enable and disable each notification, and for adjustable thresholds where appropriate.

The service must be available in both a Docker container that can be directly coupled with the Smartnode stack, and as a standalone binary for Native Mode users with instructions on creating and managing a systemd service for it.

It should also come with a pull request to our documentation guides repository (GitHub - rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net: Rocket Pool Documentation & Guide Hub) with complete and thorough documentation describing its configuration and usage for Docker, Hybrid, and Native Mode users alike.

I will also ask the Rocket Scientists to scrutinize the candidate implementation(s) from a security perspective to ensure the capability does not introduce any attack vectors or vulnerabilities.

## Optionals

Notifications should ideally support multiple different configurable endpoints; for example:
* E-mail
* Signal
* Discord DM

## Further Notes

The Smartnode does a good job of running a node in a fairly painless capacity, but one of the glaring holes is that it lacks the capacity to notify a user in a push-based scheme of important events. We recommend that users rely on a third-party service such as https://beaconcha.in for notifications of things that occur on-chain (e.g., sync committees, missed attestations, block proposals) and, to a lesser extent, information about their node’s health if the CL permits it. However, this cannot cover everything that happens with the node. For example, the following events are important enough to merit alerting the user but cannot be done by beaconcha.in:

* A new Smartnode release is out and you should update
* Your node automatically distributed your minipool balance
* One of your clients crashed and went out of sync

Having push notifications to the user would signify a substantial increase in quality of life for node operators and should result in a lower amount of people coming to the Discord’s support channel asking for help when they missed the memo on certain updates or processes.

As a final note, the beaconcha.in development team has requested that we consider this supplemental to the node’s own notification system instead of being the primary avenue for it so this must be done sooner rather than later.
