## Description

There is very little visibility into if MEV theft is happening, how frequently, how damaging, etc.
We may not be able to get exact answers, but we should get close.

## Requires
* Use bid information from flashbots
* Provide data and code in a way that can be easily run by a technical person
* Provide a report that can be read by anyone
* Share a git repository with relevant code
  * Include relevant data and/or where the data can be sourced

## Optionals
*  Use bid information from more relays (up to all of the supported ones)
*  Make a dashboard enabling non-technical users to browse the data

## Further Notes

### Detail level
* For each MEV-boost block, check if an acceptable fee recipient was used
* For each vanilla block, calculate how much was lost by not using MEV-boost

### High level
* Losses due to wrong fee recipient
  * Total ETH
  * ETH per period
  * Effect on APR
* Losses due to not using MEV-boost
  * Total ETH
  * ETH per period
  * Effect on APR
* Distribution of MEV-boost bids for
  * All block
  * All RP blocks
  * :star: All RP blocks that use MEV-boost w/correct fee recipient
  * :star: All RP blocks that use MEV-boost w/wrong fee recipient
  * :star: All vanilla RP blocks

The starred items are the real meat of this work. If those distributions look mostly the same, then we can be confident thereâ€™s negligible theft ongoing.

## Resources
* No relevant resources.
