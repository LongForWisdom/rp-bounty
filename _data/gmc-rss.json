In the last month, numerous community members have contributed top-notch ideas aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of the Rocket Pool platform.

The committee selection process will involve a combination of volunteers expressing their interest publicly and the GMC administrator reaching out for volunteers. The committee creation process is expected to last one week but can conclude at any time after the selection of 5 members. Members of the evaluation committee are ineligible for rewards from this specific bounty.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"scoring-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#scoring-2\"></a>Scoring</h4>\n<p>Each submission will be assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 in three categories: usefulness, innovativeness, and promising. The individual ratings in these categories will be summed to determine the overall score.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"rubric-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#rubric-3\"></a>Rubric</h5>\n<p>Usefulness</p>\n<p>The practical value and applicability of a submission in addressing the objectives of remaining competitive with Lido’s staking options. Submissions that provide specific actionable recommendations, demonstrate a high level of practicality, and contribute effectively to addressing the specified issues would be considered more useful.</p>\n<p>Innovativeness</p>\n<p>The degree of originality and creativity exhibited in a submission. A submission is deemed innovative if it introduces new and unique ideas or approaches, showcasing a departure from conventional methods. The evaluation committee will assess the extent to which the submission brings fresh perspectives, methodologies, or solutions to the table.</p>\n<p>Promising</p>\n<p>The potential for future success or positive outcomes associated with a submission. Submissions that are considered promising exhibit characteristics that suggest they could lead to significant impact or positive changes in the future. This may include factors such as the feasibility of the proposed ideas, their potential for high impact, and their alignment with technical and political considerations (pDAO).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"schedule-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#schedule-4\"></a>Schedule</h4>\n<p>The review process is scheduled to span two weeks following the formation of the committee.

In the last month, numerous community members have contributed top-notch ideas aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of the Rocket Pool platform. We are in need of five individuals to assess these ideas and determine their overall value. If selected, reviewers will be given a document to submit their scores and commentary. The GMC has not guaranteed compensation for reviewers yet but they have shown interest in rewarding them through a retrospective award.\nBounty Details\nPlease reply on this post if you are interested or inquire with questions. Thanks!\n–\nProcedure\nAn evaluation committee comprising a minimum of 3 members (preferably 5) will be appointed to assess the merit of each submission. The committee selection process will involve a combination of volunteers expressing their interest publicly and the GMC administrator reaching out for volunteers. The committee creation process is expected to last one week but can conclude at any time after the selection of 5 members. Members of the evaluation committee are ineligible for rewards from this specific bounty.\nScoring\nEach submission will be assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 in three categories: usefulness, innovativeness, and promising. The individual ratings in these categories will be summed to determine the overall score.\nRubric\nUsefulness\nThe practical value and applicability of a submission in addressing the objectives of remaining competitive with Lido’s staking options. Submissions that provide specific actionable recommendations, demonstrate a high level of practicality, and contribute effectively to addressing the specified issues would be considered more useful.\nInnovativeness\nThe degree of originality and creativity exhibited in a submission. A submission is deemed innovative if it introduces new and unique ideas or approaches, showcasing a departure from conventional methods. The evaluation committee will assess the extent to which the submission brings fresh perspectives, methodologies, or solutions to the table.\nPromising\nThe potential for future success or positive outcomes associated with a submission. Submissions that are considered promising exhibit characteristics that suggest they could lead to significant impact or positive changes in the future. This may include factors such as the feasibility of the proposed ideas, their potential for high impact, and their alignment with technical and political considerations (pDAO).\nSchedule\nThe review process is scheduled to span two weeks following the formation of the committee. Submissions with the highest cumulative scores will be awarded as follows: $2,500 (1st place), $1,500 (2nd place), $1,000 (3rd place 3rd - 5th place). All other applicants will receive $250. In the event of a tie, ranked choice voting will be used from data collected in the ‘Favorite Applications’ section.\nFurther Notes\nHighly prized qualities will be: specific actionable recommendations, high impact, innovation/uniqueness of ideas, persuasive discussion, evaluation of drawbacks/steel-man arguments, and feasibility from both technical and political (pDAO) standpoints.\nBreakdown of Submissions\nTotal Submissions: 21\nNeverAnIsland - Built-In RPL pool\nValdorff - MYSO Loans\nValdorff - Rent or Stake\nSamus - Diverted Rewards\nepineph - Unsmoothing Fee/lottery fee\nepineph - Universal Variable Commission\nepineph - Jaws of life- dynamically valuing RPL\nepineph - Penalties revamp\nepineph - RPL bond sliding scale\nepineph - Preferential queue for higher ETH bonded minipools\nepineph - Medipools\nepineph - Pre-signed exit messages/reusable minipool contract\nepineph - No-commission minipools\nzesty - Collateral Requirements Removal\nValdorff - Direct Capture\nValdorff - Bond Curves\nsckuzzle - Value Accruing Options\nArtDemocrat - rETH Protection\nLuominx - No RPL minipools\nOccam - No RPL megapools\nDagoDuck - Priority deposit pool (late entry)\nCheck out the community input post here.\nEdit: Given the amount of submissions, the time to review has been updated from one week to two weeks.\nEdit 2: This is for the next step of research. The job does not include checking the math/modeling.

Lido has plans to launch a more ‘decentralized’ option within a year, anticipated to allow home stakers to stake with 4E bond and 7.5% commission on the other 28E.  This will likely threaten the value proposition and growth of Rocket Pool, but more generally the idea of credible neutrality and the decentralization of the Ethereum network.  The RP protocol will need to adapt in multiple ways to meet this competition.</p>\n<p>This bounty is meant to rapidly generate actionable ideas for ways forward to drive more value to NOs specifically and the protocol in general.  The payment structure is intended to provide some financial reimbursement for diverse community members actively brainstorming solutions, as well as more heavily reward selected ideas that have a high likelihood of being translated into protocol improvements.</p>\n<p>This is a chance to get paid for ideas which you think are great for the protocol, but that you might have previously felt were too radical.  We are at a point where we need to think outside the box, and quickly.</p>\n<p>The goal after initial brainstorming is to pick several promising ideas and fund further research to get them over the finish line, voted upon, and eventually enacted.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"must-the-results-of-this-project-be-entirely-open-source-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://dao.rocketpool.net#must-the-results-of-this-project-be-entirely-open-source-3\"></a>Must the results of this project be entirely open source:</h3>\n<p>Yes.

The next funding round of GMC will not announce results until late December, so the GMC is not able to fund this prospectively even if it wished to.  On the other hand, I think it is highly likely that this bounty or something similar (perhaps larger) will be paid out retroactively, either by the GMC, the team, or another mechanism.

Lido has plans to launch a more ‘decentralized’ option within a year, anticipated to allow home stakers to stake with 4E bond and 7.5% commission on the other 28E.  This will likely threaten the value proposition and growth of Rocket Pool, but more generally the idea of credible neutrality and the decentralization of the Ethereum network.  The RP protocol will need to adapt in multiple ways to meet this competition.\nThis bounty is meant to rapidly generate actionable ideas for ways forward to drive more value to NOs specifically and the protocol in general.  The payment structure is intended to provide some financial reimbursement for diverse community members actively brainstorming solutions, as well as more heavily reward selected ideas that have a high likelihood of being translated into protocol improvements.\nThis is a chance to get paid for ideas which you think are great for the protocol, but that you might have previously felt were too radical.  We are at a point where we need to think outside the box, and quickly.\nThe goal after initial brainstorming is to pick several promising ideas and fund further research to get them over the finish line, voted upon, and eventually enacted.\nMust the results of this project be entirely open source:\nYes.  The contents of submissions will be used by the Rocket Pool community and the team.\nWork and Verification\nWhat steps would be entailed in completing the bounty? Do successful examples of such work exist elsewhere?\nThis bounty requests community members submit a brief/abstract with specific/actionable recommendations regarding any of:\nMechanisms that help balance supply/demand across the parties in the protocol:  rETH, RPL, and NOs (for example, balancing commission --rETH vs NOs-- or balancing minimum RPL bond --RPL vs NOs).\nMechanisms of alternative value capture for RPL (besides pure use as staked bond)\nMechanisms and feasibility requirements for lowering ETH bond requirement for minipools\nUpdates on the penalty system/MEV safety, including evaluating options for node level collateral\nSuggested length of 0.5-3 pages on any topic above, including specifically which topic or topics it is intended to answer.  The brief should include both perceived benefits and suspected drawbacks/downsides, further research/data/decisions needed, specific actionable recommendations, and general implementation ideas.  The brief does NOT have to be polished, complete data analysis, or specific code; it will NOT be judged on English proficiency, grammar, etc.\nThe brief should be a single work you can link to, rather than referring to a series of posts/threads.  A single individual can submit multiple works.  It can be posted as a single discord post, a forum post, a GitHub submission, an uploaded document, and any other form that can be easily viewed.\nHow long is the proposed bounty available for? Is it awarded to the first team to successfully claim it, or is it in some way divided among all such successful claims in the proposed availability period?\nThe submission period will be 21 days (end 23:59 UTC on December 26th).\nWho will test any products submitted for claiming the bounty?\nThere will be a committee to read through and review the briefs, with binding power over assigning awards. A mechanism for non-binding community voting is also likely.  The details of the committee are still pending.\nWhat is the acceptance criteria for awarding of the bounty?\nEvery serious submission will be considered.  Between 13 and 17 submissions will be rewarded with $250-2500\nHighly prized qualities will be: specific actionable recommendations, high impact, innovation/uniqueness of ideas, persuasive discussion, evaluation of drawbacks/steel-man arguments, and feasibility from both technical and political (pDAO) standpoints.\nBenefits - enter N/A where appropriate\nGroup\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\nPotential rETH holders\ncurrently there is more demand for rETH than supply; this research will help improve rETH supply so that more rETH can be owned (non-full deposit pool) for cheaper (less premium) and better APR (less drag)\n\n\nrETH holders\nthe full DP is a drag on rETH APR; this seeks to minimize that drag by increasing NO supply, and potentially reducing commission\n\n\nPotential NOs\nwe seek to increase value for NOs in ETH terms which make becoming a NO more attractive; additionally, by developing ways to drive value to RPL, we may open up options for RPL-averse NOs\n\n\nNOs\nSee potential NOs and RPL holders\n\n\nCommunity\nThis is intended to distribute bounties widely to get multiple viewpoints, particularly from those who may otherwise not be as active\n\n\nRPL holders\nRPL valuation is based in large part on capture of market share; this bounty aims to improve the ability of the market to correctly value RPL, as well as the ability for the protocol to grow.\n\n\n\n\nWhat other non-RPL protocols, DAOs, projects, or individuals, would stand to benefit from the bounty being successfully completed?\nNone, really- except those protocols that are directly emulating Rocket Pool\nWill the results of the completed bounty be open source?\nYes\nPayment\nHow much USD $ is the applicant requesting for successful completion of the bounty?\nSpecific submissions/mechanisms that are felt to be the most useful/innovative/promising for eventual adoption will receive Gold/Silver/Bronze x3 prizes ($2500, $1500, $1000 (x 3) reward levels).\nConflict of Interest\nDoes the person or persons proposing the bounty have any conflicts of interest to disclose? (Please disclose here if you are a member of the GMC or if any member of the GMC would benefit directly financially from the successful completion of the bounty).\nI am a member of the GMC.\nWill the applicant, or any protocol or project in which the applicant has a vested interest (other than Rocket Pool), benefit financially if the bounty is successfully completed?\nNo, Rocket Pool will  be the only protocol to benefit.  No one making award decisions will be the recipient of an award.  I will not be a recipient of an award.\nEpineph’s Note:\nThe team and other community members who attended DevConnect have signaled that researching options in these areas are of high importance and should take high priority.  The next funding round of GMC will not announce results until late December, so the GMC is not able to fund this prospectively even if it wished to.  On the other hand, I think it is highly likely that this bounty or something similar (perhaps larger) will be paid out retroactively, either by the GMC, the team, or another mechanism.  The GMC can use this as a template, or can suggest another way to reward foundational research.\nI will personally vouch for the amount listed above up to 10k USD distributed to at least 13 people meeting the criteria above in the unlikely event no other group comes forth with equivalent funding.  I DO NOT think this is a significant financial risk to me, but hope this provides reassurance that the work we are asking for will be rewarded.  We need your ideas now, and we value the time you spend in this critical phase of Rocket Pool’s future.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic","guid":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2515","categories":["Grants / Bounties"],"isoDate":"2023-12-05T18:25:42.000Z"},{"creator":"ShfRyn","title":"GMC 2023/11/01-2023/11/28 Treasury Report","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-2023-11-01-2023-11-28-treasury-report/2487","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 22:34:59 +0000","dc:creator":"ShfRyn","content":"\n            <p>Hello everyone.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on a Rocketpool x Bankless Academy lesson, similar to our collaberations with Optimism & 1inch.\nLesson overview:\nStaking Ether (why Ether is staked, the “Internet Bond” analogy)\nValidator Nodes (PoS Consensus overview)\nNode centralization risks (wealth concentration, 33% attacks, LSTs)\nLiquid Staking Tokens (purpose, types, benefits/risks)\nStaking economics (factors influencing returns)\nTaking an rETH position (show option of running a Rocketpool mini-node in future)\nQuest: Buy & hold rETH (accompanied by written walkthrough w/ screenshots)\nThis lesson comes with a companion article in our ‘Explorer’s Handbook’ – a how-to guide, quest walkthrough, and quick reference sheet for users seeking more concise instruction (e.g. Managing Token Allowances).\nOur grant request for lessons is $25,000, covering research, production, marketing, and lesson/quest upkeep. We also have the opportunity to translate and market this lesson + handbook companion in five languages, for an additional $5,000 grant. We are revisiting lesson agreements two years post-launch to discuss conversion rates.\nConnection with a Rocketpool staking specialist, for periodic discussion & review, would add even more punch to a collaboration. Advisory helps us to identify key analogies and make our information as accurate & concise as possible.\nInterested to hear your thoughts on the proposed material, and what improvements you might make to a possible collaboration. We’ll submit a full proposal next week based on feedback. Excited to be here, thanks in advance.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic","guid":"dao.rocketpool.net-topic-2368","categories":["Grants / Bounties"],"isoDate":"2023-11-01T12:45:01.000Z"},{"creator":"LIBlockchain","title":"Open call for RocketSplit testers (Holesky)","link":"https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/open-call-for-rocketsplit-testers-holesky/2359","pubDate":"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 16:28:15 +0000","dc:creator":"LIBlockchain","content":"\n            <p>Hello everyone!

If I instead thought Rocket Pool needed a fifty-foot paper mache orange rocket for publicity purposes but I wanted it to be open to whoever built it first to claim the reward (similar to a prize), then I’d apply for a bounty.\nTo guide you in your application, the GMC has established the following goals and the following scoring rubric:\nGMC Goals\nGrants, bounties, and retrospective awards should make it easier and/or more attractive to do one or more of the following:\nbecome a node operator\noperate a node, mint rETH\nhold or use rETH\nimprove the quality of life for the protocol and its community.\nBounty Rubric\nThe Bounties rubric involves scoring each of the three categories from 1 to 5:\nIf the bounty is completed successfully, to what extent does it further the GMC goals?\nTo what extent is it likely that the bounty can be feasibly claimed/completed successfully?\nIf the bounty is successfully completed, how large is the benefit to the protocol relative to the size of the proposed costs?\nThe maximum score is 15 and the minimum is 3.\nBounty Application\nPlease copy paste the template below into a reply.

Please only post bounty applications in this thread. If you would like to discuss and/or ask questions about any applications you see in this thread, we ask that you do so in this separate forum thread which has been established for all community discussions related to this round of applications. Only those bounty applications that are posted in this thread and timestamped by January 15, 2023 at 23:59 (11:59 PM) UTC will be considered.\nPlease note the following differences between grants and bounties. Grants are intended to be applied for by those who are wishing to carry out the work themselves. Bounties are open-ended goals that could be met by anyone, including those other than the proposing party. In other words, if I believed that Rocket Pool needed a fifty-foot paper mache orange rocket for publicity purposes and I wanted to be the one to built it, I would apply for a grant.
